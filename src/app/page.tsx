        Born in Kenya and raised in Boston, MA, I am a Software Engineer based
        in San Francisco, CA.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2019, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry at
        Tufts University. However, having had a passion for art and design
        growing up, I would always find myself on the web teaching myself how to
        design and code websits and apps, effectively igniting a love for
        programming within me.

        After college, it became very clear to me that research and medicine was
        not the field for me and I had grown a desire to learn more about
        computers and programming. In 2023, I completed my Master&apos;s in
        Computer Science and now I am on a journey to grow as an engineer and
        designer.
