        Born in Kenya and raised in Boston, MA, I am a Software Engineer based
        in San Francisco, CA.
        <br />
        <br />
        Growing up with parents in the medical professions,I studied
        Biochemistry at Tufts University. However, having had a passion for art
        and design growing up, I would always find myself on the internet
        teaching myself how to code a website, effectively igniting a love for
        programming within me.

        <br />
        After college, it became very clear to me that research and medicine was
        not the field for me and I had grown a desire to learn more about
        computers and programming. In 2023, I completed my Masterâ€™s in Computer
        Science and now I am on a journey to grow as an engineer and designer.
